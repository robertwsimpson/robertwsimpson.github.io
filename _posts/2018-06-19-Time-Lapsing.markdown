Something that people do without realizing it and in some cases underutilize as a whole is time lapse shooting with a drone.  Personally, I realized the utility of this type of shot after watching traffic with my [DJI Spark.](http://click.dji.com/ANDC8NMI2ZyRu-WjN0VR?pm=link)  Here is what I am talking about:

The effect can be acheived very easily by capturing very smooth video (with or without movement), and then just speeding the clips up in your editing software.  Sometimes, because the clip is being sped up, additional smoothing can be applied in post production to even out any shakiness that is observed.  Personally, I think that the effect can be very useful and applicable to show the passage of time or the business of life.  

Sometimes the effect can be seen in the background of a shot, which can also be very distracting.  In my experience, the slow flight speed of the lower end commercial grade drones can sometimes tempt us to speed the clip up in an effort to cover more of the shot within a smaller time period in the final product.  This is ok as long as there are no glaringly sped up items in the frame.  For example, waves crashing, cars driving, or flags flapping can all be very distracting in a video clip that has been sped up, IF this was not the intent of the clip or the edit.  Next time you're cruising drone footage, look for it.  I'm sure that you'll see it in more than one video!

After posting this video in a [forum](https://forum.dji.com/thread-138989-1-1.html) for drone footage, it was pointed out that in the strictest definition of the phrase, this is NOT technically time lapse footage.  After being offended, which is an important step in the film making process, I decided to see if there is a way to make a technically accurate time lapse video, which, in fact, it is!  Check it out!

This is definitely a more difficult way of capturing and editing something that is sped up from real time, but I think with FAR more rewarding results.  

Here is how you capture the footage for this:
1. Position your drone.  Obviously.  
2. Make sure that you're in photo mode and go to the self timer section.  Here, you can select a time interval for your photos.  I selected 2 second intervals, which is the shortest interval for the spark.
3. Set your exposure options in the photo settings.  Do not use any automatic settings.  You'll need to set your ISO, shutter speed, and white balance. 
4. If you plan on moving the drone during your time lapse, make sure that you're in tripod mode.  
5. Press the photo capture button and begin your camera movement if you are doing that.

After capturing the images to create your time lapse clip, you'll need to use a computer applicatin to stitch your images together into your initial time lapse clip.  For this, I like the [Time Lapse Assembler application](http://www.dayofthenewdan.com/projects/time-lapse-assembler-1/).  It is a free application (Donations are accepted!), and it's simple but effective.  After creating your time lapse clip, import the video into your editor as usual.

Here are some important things to remember:
1. If you are a Spark owner like me, you'll need to keep battery life in mind.  The Spark only has enough battery life for ONE of these shots.
2. Remember to calculate your final shot length to make sure that you are capturing enough footage.  To do that, use this formula: DesiredLength X FinalFPS X CaptureInterval. For example, I would like a 10 second time lapse clip at 24FPS and I'm using a 2 second interval.  10 X 24 X 2 = 480 seconds or 8 minutes of time lapse capture to generate a 10 second clip in your final product.
3. You will probably be speeding time up by 20X or more.  In my example, the video is 48X sped up.  To do this effectively, you need insanely smooth camera movements, which is a real challenge with a drone.  Tripod mode helps.
4. Using a longer shutter speed will help to blend the frames together to create a smooth final product.  At night, this is fairly easy, but during the day you may need a neutral density filter.
5. When editing, it helps to add some additional camera stabilization.  The good thing about capturing images instead of video is that you should have PLENTY of resolution to work with!

So go ahead, create some time lapse videos!
