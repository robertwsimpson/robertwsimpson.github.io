Guys! I climbed a mountain! 

Well, I didn't make it all the way to the top, but considering the fact that this was my first try, and the peak is over 14,000 feet above sea level, I did pretty well!

On a random Monday, my good friend Tanner called me and asked if I wanted to try and summit Mt. Shasta the following weekend.  Of course, I said yes!

The mountain was incredible.  It is very easy to see why people associate spiritual things with this geographical feature.  Getting up the hill is a LOT of work, but you're rewarded with insane views for a hundred miles in all directions.  

Unfortunately, due to the incliment weather and the fact that we were all rookies as far as climbing mountains goes, we did not summit the mountain, but we did make it to over 12,000 feet of elevation.  

It was certainly a good first attempt and an amazing experience!
