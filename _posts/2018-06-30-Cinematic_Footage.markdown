Cinematic - the most overused buzzword of 2018.  

If you've been looking around online for any type of drone help, whether it be piloting or videography help, you've come across this term.  But what does it mean?!

Dictionary.com defines this word as "having qualities characteristic of motion pictures."

Well, that's helpful.

Basically, everyone gets to have his own definition or concept of what the word "cinematic" means.  That being said, there are a FEW things that we can mostly all agree on:

1. final edits will have more of a cinematic quality if they are produced at 24 frames per second.  If you watch videos at 24 fps and 30 fps, they "feel" very different.  At first, it is subtle, but once you see it, it can't be unseen.
2. Video has a cinematic quality if the 180 degree rule is followed.  This rule states that your shutter speed should be one over double your frame rate.  For example, if your camera is set to shoot at 24 FPS, your shutter speed should be 1/48th of a second (on most cameras, you'd be shooting at 1/50th since 1/48th is not an option).  If your camera is set to 30 FPS, 1/60th of a second. 

After these rules, things become a bit more muddy and up for interpretation.  In my opinion, though, you need to know the rules, so that you know when you're breaking them, and it's on purpose.  With my history in photography, these rules come a little more naturally than most, although camera movement has been something that I've had to work on a lot.  There are countless articles online about composition and cinematic camera movements.  It would do all of us some good to keep up to date on what is generally accepted, since every so often something comes along (like the infamous matrix shots) that change everything.

With the use of drones, a whole new arena of cinematic b-roll has become accessible to the common man.  The tendency, when this happens, is overuse, but drone shots can be amazingly effective as a supplement to other videography.

With my Spark, I am extremely limited with what I can do.  I cannot set the aperture to create any depth of field, I cannot focus the lense, and I cannot change the frame rate.  This means that without the use of neutral density filters, you are stuck with a shutter speed that is way too high in the middle of the day.  As always, there are ways to creatively solve these issues.

As usual, instead of being helpful, I will take a tongue in cheek shot at all of the cinematic shots and tutorials that are out there.  Enjoy!
