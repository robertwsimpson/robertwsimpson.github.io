This is a love story.

For almost two decades, I have been in a very committed relationship with Single Lens Reflex cameras, both analog and digital.  I love everything about them.  I love the way that they compliment my larger than normal hands.  I love the satisfying ka-chink sound that they make when I take a photo.  I even loved shooting video on them, although, at first, I was very confused about this aspect of our relationship.

Then, along came the mirrorless cameras.  I enjoyed viewing them from afar, as a conscientious objector.  I liked the fact that they were smaller, but I was confused by their retained ability to swap lenses, which made them bigger than they needed to be.  

Years went by. 

As I began to become interested in producing video content, I decided that the 5D Mark II was not the best tool for what I wanted to do anymore, and the 1D Mark III definitely wasn't.  I began to do some research in cameras with flippy screens and the ability to keep Auto Focus going while shooting video. 

Enter the M50.

Because of its small size, laser accurate auto-focus, and ability to use the L lenses that I already owned, the M50 seemed to fit the bill best.  I decided to pull the trigger and purchase the camera.  We've been so happy ever since.
