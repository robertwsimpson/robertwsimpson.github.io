Flying and shooting videos with your drone is a challenge, but if you're not concentrated on editing and producing your video as well, you're missing 50% of the equation!

trimming your shots can get rid of unintentional movement and boring content.  Putting music behind your clips can add emotion.  Color grading and adding transitions can take your video beyond the next level.  

**For me, step 1 is always to pick and trim my video clips.**  Remember that if you're trying to reach a broad audience, your video needs to grab attention and stay interesting.  Here is an example of what I look for when editing my drone footage:

**Step 2 is to add a music track and begin to trim your clips.**  Syncing your clips to a music track is a powerful way to keep your viewers' attention.  To sync clips, the main tools in your bag are the blade tool and the retime tool.

**Step 3 is to add a final color grade and any final editing of your clips.**  This can include sharpening, changing the frame blending, and color grading.  Remember to watch your entire video several times and be VERY critical of your final product, because your audience will be!
