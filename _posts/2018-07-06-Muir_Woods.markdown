For a humbling and awe inspiring experience, it's hard to beat a visit to Muir Woods National Monument, just a quick drive north of San Francisco.

Hiking around the hundreds of acres of old growth coastal redwoods is an unbelievable experience.  These trees can reach hundreds of years old, and hundreds of feet tall.  Few things on Earth can make you feel smaller.

In March of this year, we took a trip out to the woods for a hike.  I also took the Spark in hopes of capturing some of the amazing scenery and attempting to do it justice.  From panoramic shots of Stinson Beach to flowing shots of Mount Tamalpais, I think I got close to showing the breathtaking nature that is inside of this park.

On of my favorite shots that I've taken with the Spark starts at 0:59.  The camera moves forward and tilts downward as the drone travels past a cliff overlooking the pacific ocean.  The camera shot together with the music get me right in the feels every time. 

I hope you enjoy this video of Muir Woods!
