Northern California is amazing.  

Where we have been living for the last 4 years, the temperature is perfect, there is almost no rain, and the skies are rarely even cloudy.  

Within easy driving distance, you can reach the beach, ski slopes, amazing hiking trails, and one of the coolest cities I've been to (San Francisco).  Hopefully, in prior blog posts, I've represented the epic nature of this part of the country.

Unfortunately, since so many people want to live in this relatively small area, **EVERYTHING** is really expensive.  In fact, for us, it became unsustainable.  

So that we could have a better quality of life, more quality time together, and possibly even some savings for rainy days, we decided to move back to Florida.  It was not an easy decision, but being closer to family made it much easier.  The kids couldn't be more excited!
