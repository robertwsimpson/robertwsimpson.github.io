Back in February, my family and I took a trip out to Tahoe from our home in San Mateo.  We had such a great time.

I had a few chances to fly the Spark, and it did great!  I got a few low temperature warnings, and the drone didn't seem to like the snow much (proximity sensors going off a LOT), but WOW, I got some spectacular footage I think.  I love the way that the sun looks on the snow.  There is something spiritual about snowy mountains.

I hope you like my drone footage of Lake Tahoe, CA!
