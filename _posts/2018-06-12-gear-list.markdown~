Before I share with you the tools that I use to collect photos and video, I feel the need to say that the hardware in your arsenal means nothing without the knowledge of how to use it and the ability to visualize and execute.  Entire movies and music videos are being shot on cellphones these days!  That being said, here are the tools that I use:

**Cameras:**  
Canon 5D Mark II  
Canon 1D Mark III  
Canon M50  
Apple iPhone 7 Plus  

**Lenses:**  
EF 24mm F1.4L  
EF 50mm F1.4  
EF 135mm F2L  
EF 17-40mm F4L  
EF 24-105mm F4L IS  
EF 100-400mm F4.5-5.6L IS  
EF-M 15-45mm F3.5-6.3 IS STM  
EF-M 22mm F2 STM  
EF 1.4x III
