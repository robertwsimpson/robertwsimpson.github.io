For the last 4 years, my family and I have been fortunate to call Northern California home.  It's been an amazing place to live.  The weather is spectacular, and the scenery is out of this world. 

One of our favorite places to visit has been Half Moon Bay, which is on the coast, just south of San Francisco.  It's a truly beautiful place, and although the mountains do afford an elevated view of the area, seeing it from a drone's perspective is magical.  Check it out!

We were able to stay at the Ritz Carlton in Half Moon Bay twice.  The hotel is incredible.  It is perched on seaside cliffs with a golf course surrounding it.  A lot of the area tends to be colored with dull browns and tans most of the time, but the grounds at the Ritz stay a beautiful emerald green all year long.  Since the hotel has a Scottish theme, one of the highlites is making smores at the fire pits at sunset listening to bagpipes play.

Again, an amazing perspective to take in the sights is from the air.  Check it out!

If you ever get the chance to visit Half Moon Bay, take it!
