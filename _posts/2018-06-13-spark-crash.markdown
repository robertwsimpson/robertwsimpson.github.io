Not too long ago, I entered the world of aerial photography/videography.  I bought my Spark with the flymore bundle just when the spark came out.  I still can't believe that you can purchase an actual flying camera for such a small amount of money.  for quite a while, I had great times taking photographs and making video with my spark, incident free.  

As with most things, the more time went by, the braver I got with my spark.  I began to fly farther away, to push the battery life to the limit, to fly to higher altitudes... having near misses all along the way.  I think that near misses are actually good, as long as you're in the right environment.  It's important to learn the limits of what your equipment is capable of and how to deal with things when they go awry.

One day, while attempting to capture some photos of my kids flying kites, my somewhat inaccurate depth perception bit me and I had a mid-air collision between the Spark and a kite.  Fortunately, the kite was fine, but Sparky was not.

As important as learning the limits of your equipment is becoming familiar with the inner workings of it.  And boy did I.
